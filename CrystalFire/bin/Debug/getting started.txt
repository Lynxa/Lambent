DAMMAGE - A Framework for Describing And Monitoring Multi-AGent Environments
Version: 1.1  Release: 01/07/2015  Author: Loizos Michael (loizos@ouc.ac.cy)
============================================================================

Installation and execution instructions:
----------------------------------------

01. Decompress and place the distributed system files into a new folder. Let
	`%DAMMAGE%` be the path where the distributed system files are placed.

02. Obtain ECLiPSe (from `http://eclipseclp.org/Distribution/6.0_188/i386_nt/`
	or `%DAMMAGE%\utils\`), and install it following the instructions given
	by the application. Let `%ECLIPSE%` be the path where ECLiPSe is installed.
	
03. Copy all files found in `%ECLIPSE%\lib\i386_nt\` into `%DAMMAGE%\utils\`.

04. If needed, the host and sockets used for communication between the modules
	of the system can be changed, by editing the command files in `%DAMMAGE%\`.
	By changing the host names, it is possible to have each module run on some
	different machine, and communicate with other modules over some network.

05. Once the system is installed, its modules can be activated by executing the
	command files in `%DAMMAGE%` in the numbered order, from 1 through 5. In
	case the modules will be running on different machines, they should still
	be executed in the prescribed order, each on its respective machine.

06. Make sure you unblock the system from accepting incoming connections.

07. When the simulation module is activated, it asks for the name of a file
	containing the domain to be loaded. The filename should include the path
	relative to `%DAMMAGE%`, and should use slashes instead of backslashes. So,
	to load the example domain `english.pl` found in `%DAMMAGE%\domains\`, one
	should type `"./domains/english.pl".` when prompted as above for a domain.

08. Once the domain is loaded, the simulation commences, and the registration
	module waits for agents to join and participate in the simulated domain.

09. Example agents for the domain `%DAMMAGE%\domains\english.pl` can be found
	in `%DAMMAGE%\agents\`, and can be activated by executing the command files
	in `%DAMMAGE%` numbered 6. Real users can also participate in a simulated
	domain, by executing the command files in `%DAMMAGE%` numbered 7 and/or 8,
	and entering the actions they wish to invoke in the user module interface.

10. Type `shutdown.` in the administration module interface to exit the system.
